## About

I'm Alvin Veroy, a technology consultant based in the Philippines. My work centers on cybersecurity, infrastructure, and helping organizations navigate digital challenges with practical solutions.

Over the years, I've had the opportunity to:

- Work with vulnerability disclosure for platforms like GCash and Viber
- Contribute to civic technology through projects like [BetterGov.ph](https://github.com/bettergovph) as a volunteer and contributor
- [TechWatchPH.com](https://techwatchph.com/) Columnist "DECODED: TECH PERSPECTIVE"
- Build tools like CodeCompass for automation and development
- Previous contributions to [ai.fosshub.com](https://ai.fosshub.com/about-us/)

My approach is straightforward: understand the problem, find what works, and share what I learn along the way.
