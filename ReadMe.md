## About Me

Hello! My name is Alvin Veroy, and I'm a technology leader with a passion for innovation. I have over 25 years of experience in the technology industry and have guided my clients through complex technology projects.

I started my career at an established technology firm and worked my way up to a senior leadership role. During my time there, I gained experience in various technologies, leading teams, and successfully delivering projects.

Throughout my career, innovation has been vital for me. I strive to identify trends in the industry and apply them to my projects to achieve successful outcomes. Additionally, I take opportunities for improvement and implementation seriously, thus introducing new technologies into various projects. 

Aside from professional work, I have also been involved with several start-ups. My knowledge and experience have played an invaluable part in launching and growing these businesses. In addition to having an intimate understanding of current security protocols, technologies, and standards; I'm also an early adopter of cybersecurity, zero trust environment implementations, confidential computing cloud technologies, containerization and more!

## My Life Story

I was always a very curious child, and I had a voracious appetite for reading. I especially loved books about science and other interesting topics. As a youngster, I enjoyed tinkering with toys and taking them apart to see how they worked. 

When I turned 12 years old, I got my first videogame console - the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Sadly though, the controllers started to malfunction. It was then that I stumbled upon an electronic repair shop in my neighborhood where the owner kindly taught me how to repair my NES controller. This experience sparked an interest in electronics within me, which was further fuelled by the many books about electronics stocked in my school library - particularly "Electronic Enthusiast" from Alexan. 

I soon found myself traveling to Quiapo's RAON area in pursuit of electronic components and parts. 

My love of electronics led to an interest in programming. I was particularly interested in 8086 assembly, but the resources available to me in the pre-Google era were limited and the language was too complex for my age. So I set out to find something more suitable to my level - and I eventually stumbled across GW-BASIC.

GW-BASIC was a good entry point for me and I quickly got the hang of it. But I was hungry for more - something with a little more power and potential. I eventually got my hands on a copy of Turbo Pascal, and that opened up a whole world of possibilities. I was able to learn the basics of HTML, JavaScript and PHP, and I began to dabble with building my own web apps, including one that allowed me to send messages to my pager!

It was the pre-bubble Dotcom period and the internet was still relatively new and unexplored. I was fascinated by the possibilities of building something online, so I decided to teach myself. Back then, there was no Google to look up tutorials and materials, so I had to rely on books, bbs, irc, plenty of early online forums, manipulating search keywords on early search enginges like altavista, yahoo and excite; and my own initiative. I was determined to learn and, luckily, I had some natural aptitude for the craft.

## Co-Founded a Like-Minded Group in IRC

In 1998 I co-founded a local computer enthusiast group in my area. We used to meet up in various internet cafes and chat rooms using IRC, a primitive Internet chatroom. One of the things we used to do was exchange technical information and discussed our projects. 

Back then, there was a lot of curiosity and enthusiasm around computers, and we would often share tips and tricks on hacking into systems and exploring the possibilities of technology. We were fascinated with exploring the boundaries of computing and seeing what it can achieve with the right expertise. 

Eventually, I became increasingly involved in the group, learning more and more about hacking and security. I was exposed to cybersecurity before it was even a profession, and I quickly became passionate about it. I joined clubs, took courses, and worked on my projects. I even had a few gratifying successes. 

Soon enough, I found myself interviewed by Time Magazine and CNN. They were fascinated by my story and my work. Their coverage of my journey to become a hacker provided me with the perfect resume for a lucrative job in the U.S.

Out of this group, I met some great people I am still friends with today, and we continue to meet up from time to time and share stories of our exploits. It was a great learning experience, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to be a part of it.

## Clinical Depression and Dotcom Bubble Burst

When the dotcom bubble burst, I was left with no way to make a living. I was also battling depression which had become increasingly difficult to cope with. With no other option available, I had to start from the bottom. 

I became a store clerk, an amusement ride operator, a restaurant dishwasher, a line cook, and eventually, a restaurant manager. Through this journey, I was finally able to afford the medication I needed. It was also during this journey that I met Dr. David Wright. He had a Ph.D. in psychology and was starting a biomechanics startup. I was intrigued, so I decided to get involved. 

In my free time, I joined several new tech startups as an IT contractor, offering my skills and solutions. I enjoyed the challenge of learning new technology and coming up with creative solutions.

## A Cryptocurrency Rollercoaster Ride: An Exciting Journey Through the World of Blockchain and Initial Coin Offerings!

It all started in 2012 when I tried to mine Bitcoin on my spare laptop. Like many others, I was fascinated by the potential of this revolutionary technology, and I decided to start mining for Bitcoin and Litecoin. During my early days in the crypto world, I wanted to make a difference by forking Litecoin and creating my own Initial Coin Offering (ICO). 

So, in 2017 I decided to take a leap of faith and return to the Philippines to become "the prime mover of blockchain technology." Full of ambition and enthusiasm, I was confident that with my knowledge, experience, and passion for blockchain technology, I could help put the Philippines on the map as an early adopter of cryptocurrency. 

I got to work on developing a startup - but soon found out that things could be more complex. Every country has different values, regulations, and cultures, which posed a challenge when bringing my vision to life. Furthermore, I was greatly hindered by the fact that most people around me didn't truly understand blockchain technology or its potential applications - making it difficult to negotiate partnerships or build meaningful collaborations. 

Despite these challenges, I persevered, learning as much as possible about how blockchain technology works in different countries. As time passed, it became apparent that the Silicon Valley-style tech startup would not work in the Philippines. So eventually, after several months of development work on my startup project, I realized that it wouldn't be possible to make an impact in this way. 

I'm grateful for what this roller coaster journey taught me about blockchain technology - particularly lessons about how countries approach its development. This experience also gave me a greater understanding of the importance of solid networks to succeed in any venture, which has been invaluable since then!
